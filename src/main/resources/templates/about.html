        <div class="text">Welcome to FitPlanner — your personal space for building healthier habits,
            staying motivated, and reaching your fitness goals at your own pace.
            We created FitPlanner for people who want a smarter, more flexible way to plan their workouts,
            whether you're brand-new to training or already deep into your fitness journey.</div>
        <div class="text">With FitPlanner, you’re in control. You can easily create your own workout programs
            by choosing from a wide list of exercises and adjusting sets, reps, rest times, and more.
            Whether you prefer strength training, cardio, mobility work, or a mix of everything,
            building the perfect routine is simple and intuitive.</div>
        <div class="text">If you’d rather start with something prepared, FitPlanner offers ready-made
            programs created by experienced trainers. You can follow them as they are,
            or use them as inspiration for your own personalized plan. Both customers
            and trainers can share their programs publicly, creating a growing
            library of routines for all fitness levels.</div>
        <div class="text">FitPlanner is designed to grow with you. Our smart progression algorithm tracks
            your training streaks and suggests when it's time to increase or decrease intensity,
            helping you stay challenged without overtraining. Whether you're aiming to get stronger,
            fitter, or simply more consistent, the app adapts to your performance
            so you can keep improving safely.
            We know that everyone starts somewhere — and everyone progresses differently.
            That’s why FitPlanner includes multiple difficulty levels, ensuring that beginners,
            intermediates, and advanced athletes all find programs that suit their needs.</div>
        <div class="text">At FitPlanner, our mission is simple: make fitness planning easier,
            smarter, and more personal.
            Your goals matter. Your progress matters.
            And we’re here to help you stay on track, one workout at a time.</div>
        <div class="text">Welcome to the future of personalized training.</div>
